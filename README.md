# Remote-Controlled-Robot-without-using-any-MCU
The "Remote Controlled Vehicle Without Using Any Microcontroller" project focuses on designing and constructing a fully operational remote-controlled vehicle using only basic electronic components.
By avoiding the use of microcontrollers, this project emphasizes the core principles of electronics and control systems. 
It serves as an excellent educational platform for those looking to deepen their understanding of fundamental electronic concepts and practical circuit design.
